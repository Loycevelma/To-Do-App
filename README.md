# To-Do-App
React To-Do-Application
This React Native To-Do app provides users with an intuitive interface to manage their tasks, allowing them to create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. The tasks are stored locally using **AsyncStorage**, ensuring persistence even after the app is closed or restarted. Key components of the app include a task list, a button for adding tasks, and a modal form for editing or creating tasks. The app also allows for toggling the completion status of tasks, visually distinguishing completed ones with a strikethrough. Challenges encountered included managing state for task updates and editing, implementing data persistence with AsyncStorage, and handling UI updates for completed tasks. These were resolved through conditional rendering, state management via React hooks, and proper AsyncStorage methods for saving and loading tasks. Future improvements could include adding search and filter functionality, task prioritization, notifications, and potential API integration for remote task management. The project highlights essential React Native concepts, including state management, local storage, and efficient list updates, while offering a practical solution for task management.
